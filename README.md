# Personal-Undertale-Fangame
This project is something that I started making during sophomore year while in my first Game Design class.
The game is programmed by me from the ground up - down to the mechanics - with the assets being a combination of 
self-made sprites and sprites from the Nintendo DS game Jump Ultimate Stars.

This game is a full on recreation of the popular indie game Undertale, which is one of my favorite games of all time, but with a slight twist...
it's now in the world of Dragon Ball.
The game starts at the end of a genocide run in which you have killed all of Goku's closest companions, leaving only you and a furious saiyan.
Do you have what it takes to bring down the most formidable saiyan....or will you perhaps see the error of your ways and...reset?
